# Simple introduction

add an app named "App"

## Three points

It has three points.

1. It can get time and show
2. It has a button to change the state(just a word)
3. It has a game --guess number(If you win, It can random a number and start a new game)

## About test

I change the package.json and the command```npm test```is ```mocha --compilers js:babel-core/register``` so that we can use mocha directly.
